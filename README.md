This repository focuses on predicting diabetes risk based on patient health metrics. The project utilizes Python, data preprocessing techniques, and machine learning models to develop an efficient predictive system for early detection and healthcare intervention.

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes patient data with features such as:

Demographics: Age, Gender
Health Metrics: Blood Pressure, Glucose Levels, Insulin Levels, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function
Medical History: Family history of diabetes, and related conditions
Objective
Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health metrics and demographic data.

**Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:**
Handled missing values, normalized data, and performed feature scaling.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.

**Machine Learning Models:**
Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Compared model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
